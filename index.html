         <p>Let's be honest everyone, we've seen this guy atleast once in our life.The boy you see above is Ash Ketchum, known as Satoshi in Japan, is a fictional character in the Pokémon franchise owned by Nintendo. He is a 10 year old Pokémon Trainer from Pallet Town whose goal is to become a Pokémon Master. His starter Pokémon was a Pikachu that he received from Professor Oak after arriving late at his laboratory.
         The pikachu didn't obey Ash in the beginning but after a tragic incident they both became inseperable.</p>

         <p> As you can see the above image, Ash is being chased by a flock of spearows. It all started when Ash just started his journey.
         He encountered a wild pidgey and tried to capture it by making it battle with his pikachu, but it didn't obey his orders.
         So Ash decided to do the work by himself and threw a stone at the spearow which hit its head. And so, the hurt spearow called
         its flock to attack the enemy (Ash and Pikachu). Ash immediately grabbed his pikachu and started to run like crazy.
         After some time a rainstorm began and Ash had no escape. Now, his dear Pikachu jumped from his shoulder and uses one of its
         thunder attacks to paralyze te whole flock.</p>
         <div class="center">

         </div>
         <p>After this tragic incident, they both became extremely exhausted and Ash felt the bonding between him and his pokemon partner.
         Their journey starts here and they both are inseperable. In their journey they meet a lot of other pokemons, trainers, gym leaders, and even villains.
         Take a look at the video below to see how ash was attacked.</p>
